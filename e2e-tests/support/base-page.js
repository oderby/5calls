  /**
   * Helper method to wait for an element to be on the page and then return it.
   *
   * When using the plain driver.wait, I was seeing 'stale element' exceptions
   * after page refreshes. I suspect this is due certain DOM elements locatable
   * using the same selector on both the basic index.html returned from the
   * server and in the updated DOM after Choo upgrades the page. In which case,
   * it's a race between Choo upgrading the page and the driver.wait call.
   *
   * Experimentally, grabbing the element explicitly a second time, after the
   * driver.wait call returns solved all of my problems. However, given the
   * above analysis, this doesn't seem like it would remove the race, just make
   * it more likely to resolve to the upgraded DOM elements. If we run into such
   * issues again, a more comprehensive fix may be required.
   *
   * Also, see
   * https://watirmelon.blog/2016/08/02/adding-your-own-webdriverjs-helper-methods/
   * for indirect discussion of another way of addressing the 'stale element'
   * exceptions in SPA like ours.
